Badges are status descriptors used to highlight a relevant content.

## Import

```tsx
import { Badge } from '@faststore/ui'
```

## Usage

### Default
```tsx live
<Badge>-25%</Badge>
```

### When to use

Use badges to highlight:

- On-sale products.
- Product collection, for example, `summer`or `prom`.
- Product status, for example, `new` or `only 1 left`.

```tsx live
<Card>
<Badge>On-sale</Badge>
  <CardImage>
    <img
      alt="Laptop on-sale"
      src="https://bit.ly/3DcQ6U6"
    />
  </CardImage>
</Card>
```

## Props

<PropsSection name="Badge" />

## Customization
Use the following attribute to customize your component: 

`data-store-badge`

## Best Practices

- Write clear and short labels.
- Have a clear position of the badge to identify which product the badge is related.

## Accessibility

- Ensure that the badge has sufficient color contrast in comparison to the background, according to 
the [WCAG 2 AA contrast ratio thresholds](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.3/color-contrast?application=axeAPI).

- Ensure every id attribute value is unique
